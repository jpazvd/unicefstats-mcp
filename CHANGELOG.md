# Changelog

All notable changes to unicefstats-mcp are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- **`server.json`**: dropped the `packages[]` Docker entry that was added in v0.4.0. The entry advertised `transport.type=sse, port=8000` for an image that was never actually published — PROVENANCE.md §3 confirms Docker is build-from-source only. Removed it so that registry consumers don't infer a published Docker artifact exists.

### Fixed
- **`scripts/check_version_consistency.py`**: cleaned up mismatch reporting. (a) Dropped the string-lex canonical selection — `max(found_values)` is a string max, not a semver max, so once any component reached two digits the MISMATCH labels would lie about which file was wrong (`max("0.10.0", "0.9.0") == "0.9.0"` lexically). (b) Dropped the redundant per-location loop — `main()`'s top loop already prints every location's version, so rebuilding the same lines into the errors list mixed informational output with `MISSING:` errors. The OK path is unchanged.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **PROVENANCE.md** — comprehensive provenance and trust documentation covering data origin, ownership, distribution pipeline, verification steps, and interpretation caveats aligned with UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics
- **`get_server_metadata()` tool** — machine-readable identity, version, publisher, data source, and provenance information at runtime (8th tool, no API call)
- **"How to Verify This MCP" section** in README — 6-step verification protocol (source repo, PyPI, version alignment, attestations, runtime, registry)
- **Identity section** in README — canonical MCP ID, official sources, mirror warning for third-party directories
- **Version consistency check script** (`scripts/check_version_consistency.py`) — validates version alignment across pyproject.toml, server.json, `__init__.py`, and server.py

### Changed
- **server.json** upgraded with full registry metadata — author, license, tools/resources/prompts manifest, data source details, provenance block with verification URLs, Docker transport entry
- **README key documents table** now includes PROVENANCE.md
- **README tools table** updated to 8 tools
- Version bump: 0.3.3 → 0.4.0 across all files (including fix for FastMCP constructor which was stuck at 0.3.2)

### Fixed
- **Version inconsistency**: FastMCP constructor `version` was "0.3.2" while all other locations were "0.3.3" — now all synchronized at 0.4.0

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-26

### Benchmark Results (v0.3.0 + unicefdata v2.4.0)
- **EQA = 0.990** across 400 positive queries (200 R1 + 200 R2, 40 countries, 0 overlap)
- **All 10 indicators at EQA >= 0.95** — 7 of 10 at perfect 1.000
- **Replicated**: R1 EQA = 0.990, R2 EQA = 0.990 (independent country samples)
- **T1 hallucination**: 7% (down from 14% in v0.2.0)
- **T2 hallucination**: 37% raw / ~10% corrected (down from 38% in v0.2.0)
- **Cost**: $0.018/query (down 24% from $0.024 in v0.2.0, due to fewer tool rounds)
- **3-way comparison**: unicefstats-mcp (EQA 0.990) vs sdmx-mcp (0.074) vs bare LLM (0.147)

### Added
- **4 MCP Resources** — preloaded reference data, no tool call needed ([OECD-MCP](https://github.com/isakskogstad/OECD-MCP) pattern)
  - `unicef://llm-instructions` — DO/DON'T rules, workflow guide, common mistakes, indicator families
  - `unicef://categories` — all indicator categories with counts
  - `unicef://countries` — ISO3 codes and names
  - `unicef://glossary` — disaggregation codes, indicator prefixes, data notes
- **Source citations** in every `get_data()` response — verifiable SDMX API URL and web link to data.unicef.org ([US Census Bureau MCP](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/us-census-bureau-data-api-mcp) pattern)
- **Retry with exponential backoff** for SDMX API calls — 3 attempts, 1s/2s/4s delays, skips 404s ([IBGE Brazil MCP](https://github.com/SidneyBissoli/ibge-br-mcp) pattern)
- **SSE transport** option for remote deployment (`--transport sse --port 8000`)
- **Status field** in all responses — `status: "ok"` or `status: "error"` for unambiguous LLM parsing
- **Indicator code validation** — rejects empty/whitespace/too-long codes before API call
- **Year range validation** — rejects years outside 1900–2100
- **NaN/inf cleaning** — `_clean_nans()` ensures valid JSON in all DataFrame-based responses
- **Type annotations** — `_get_ud() -> types.ModuleType`, mypy overrides for unicefdata/fastmcp
- **3-way benchmark** — Condition C (sdmx-mcp) added to existing A/B benchmark
- **Synonym expansion** in `search_indicators` — "births under 18" → MNCH_BIRTH18, "caesarean" → MNCH_CSEC, "teenage pregnancy" → MNCH_BIRTH18, plus 20+ common term mappings
- **Configurable benchmark** — `BENCHMARK_SEED`, `BENCHMARK_OUTPUT_DIR`, `BENCHMARK_COUNTRIES=R2` environment variables for reproducible replication runs
- **B-only benchmark script** (`03_rerun_condition_b.py`) — reuses existing A responses, runs only MCP condition

### Fixed
- `if start_year` → `if start_year is not None` — year=0 was silently ignored
- Non-numeric period values in `get_temporal_coverage` — now extracts 4-digit year prefix as fallback
- Tool extraction took oldest row instead of latest in `_extract_from_tool_calls`

### Changed
- Country column detection extracted to `country_col()` helper (was duplicated in 3 places)
- Version bump: `__init__.py`, `server.py`, `pyproject.toml` all at 0.3.0

### Documentation
- **Experimental/Research Prototype** disclaimer with human-in-the-loop warning
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — dev setup, code style, commit conventions, PR template
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** — Contributor Covenant v2.1
- **Issue/PR templates** — bug report, feature request, PR checklist
- **Landscape section** in README — 20 official statistics MCP servers compared
- **Relationship to sdmx-mcp** section with 3-way benchmark table
- **Related work bibliography** — 15 papers on tool-augmented hallucination
- **5 publication figures** (PNG + SVG) and statistical analysis script
- **MCP-DIRECTORY-STATS.md** — comprehensive directory of all stats MCP servers

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-23

### Added
- **EQA benchmark pipeline** — ground truth from UNICEF SDMX API, Anthropic API calls for both conditions
  - `00_build_ground_truth.py` — fetches, classifies, samples 300 queries
  - `benchmark_eqa.py` — runs A/B benchmark, saves to parquet
  - `01_run_direct_supplement.py` — adds direct-prompt queries to existing run
- **Parquet output** with 48 columns including full LLM responses
- **Anti-hallucination directive** — `confirmed_absent` status with explicit instruction not to fabricate
- **Semantic context** in `get_indicator_info()` — related indicators, disambiguation, SDG targets, methodology
- **Trend computation** — 5-year annualized rate of change (AARC) in `get_data()` responses
- **Balanced sampling** — 20 queries per indicator (10 latest + 5 T1 + 5 T2)
- **Refusal detection** in value extraction pipeline

### Results
- **v1.3 definitive**: EQA = 0.785 (latest), 0.843 (direct) — 7/10 indicators at perfect 1.000
- **Wilcoxon signed-rank**: p = 1.64e-14, Cohen's d = 1.34 (large effect)
- **T2 hallucination**: 38% (MCP) vs 12% (alone) — driven by ground truth misclassification
